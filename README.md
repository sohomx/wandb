### Installation

Ensure to install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
!pip install langchain==0.0.350 openai faiss-gpu tiktoken
!pip install wandb
```

## Environment Setup

Set up the required environment variables and configurations:

### Setting API Key
Fetch and set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication. This key is essential for OpenAI's functionality and can be retrieved from Google Colab's user data.

### Wandb Tracing
Enable the tracing feature for `wandb` in the `langchain` library by setting `LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING` to "true" in the environment.

## Document Processing

This code handles a PDF document ("CommonInsuranceTerms.pdf") through the following steps:

### Loading the Document
Utilizes `langchain.document_loaders.PyPDFLoader` to load the PDF file into the environment.

### Chunking Text
Divides the loaded document into smaller text chunks using `langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. These chunks are used for further processing.

## Embeddings and Vector Stores

Convert text chunks into embeddings using OpenAI's language model (`langchain.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings`) and store these embeddings in a vector store using `langchain.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS`.

## Question-Answering Chain

Construct a retrieval-based question-answering chain (`langchain.chains.RetrievalQA`) that uses OpenAI's language model for answering questions. Configuration details include:

- **Language Model**: Utilizes OpenAI's language model with a temperature parameter set to 0.3.
- **Chain Type**: Configures the chain type as "stuff".
- **Retriever Setup**: Configures the chain with a retriever generated from the earlier vector store.

## Usage

After setting up the environment and processing the document, you can interact with the QA chain by asking specific questions. For instance:

```python
print(qa_chain.run("What is Mortality Charge?"))
print(qa_chain.run("Tell me about Preferred provider organization (PPO)."))
```
